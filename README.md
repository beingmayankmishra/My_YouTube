# Hey everyone! I’m really happy to share the YouTube Clone I’ve been working on. It’s a video streaming platform inspired by YouTube, but with some unique features and my own twist on the design and functionality.
# 🌟 Cool Features in the Project:
# 🎙️ Voice Search: Just speak, and find what you’re looking for instantly.
# 🔍 Real-Time Search & Suggestions: Get instant results as you type, making browsing faster and smarter.
# 🌙 Dark Mode: Switch to a sleek, eye-friendly look.
# ✨ Shimmer UI Effect: Smooth and visually appealing loading effects.
# 💬 Real Comments with Likes: Comments feel more interactive and real with a like feature.
# 🏷️ Filter by Tags: Easily find videos based on categories and tags.
# 🛠️ Tech Stack I Used:
# React.js for building the frontend.
# Redux Toolkit for managing the app’s state.
# Firebase for authentication and backend.
# Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
# YouTube API for fetching and displaying videos.

# This project has been a fantastic learning experience! I’ve sharpened my skills in React, APIs, and state management while working on user-friendly features like real-time search suggestions, voice search, dark mode, and shimmer effects.
